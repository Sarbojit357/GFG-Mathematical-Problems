# Mathematical DSA Problems - Java Solutions

Welcome to my repository! Here, I upload my Java solutions to various **mathematical-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I solve on **GeeksforGeeks**. This repository serves as a personal archive of solutions, a way to document my learning journey, and a resource for others exploring similar problems.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- Each problem has a separate `.java` file.
- File names correspond to the problem titles for easy identification.
- Comments within the code explain the logic and approach used to solve the problem.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Categories

The problems in this repository primarily focus on:
- **Number Theory**
- **Mathematical Algorithms**
- **Optimization Techniques**
- **Combinatorics**
- **Prime Numbers and Divisors**
